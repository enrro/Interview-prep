/*
Given a binary search tree (BST), find the lowest common ancestor (LCA) of two given nodes in the BST.

According to the definition of LCA on Wikipedia: “The lowest common ancestor is defined between two nodes p and q as the lowest node in T that has both p and q as descendants (where we allow a node to be a descendant of itself).”

 

Example 1:


Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 8
Output: 6
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 8 is 6.
Example 2:


Input: root = [6,2,8,0,4,7,9,null,null,3,5], p = 2, q = 4
Output: 2
Explanation: The LCA of nodes 2 and 4 is 2, since a node can be a descendant of itself according to the LCA definition.
Example 3:

Input: root = [2,1], p = 2, q = 1
Output: 2
 

Constraints:

The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [2, 105].
-109 <= Node.val <= 109
All Node.val are unique.
p != q
p and q will exist in the BST.

If p or q are found on the left it stops and returns that node and doesn’t check the rest of the left sub tree.
Why?
Because if second node (p or q) is somewhere below in the current left sub tree – then current node is LCA and it already has it. 
How does it know whether second node is below in the current sub tree or not? 
It goes to check a right branch.
If right branch doesn’t have second node then it’s somewhere below in the left sub tree where we found first p or q and it’s below the node we already found so the node we found on the left is LCA.
