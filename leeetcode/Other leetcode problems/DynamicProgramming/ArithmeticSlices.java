/*

An integer array is called arithmetic if it consists of at least three elements and if the difference between any two consecutive elements is the same.

For example, [1,3,5,7,9], [7,7,7,7], and [3,-1,-5,-9] are arithmetic sequences.
Given an integer array nums, return the number of arithmetic subarrays of nums.

A subarray is a contiguous subsequence of the array.

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,2,3,4]
Output: 3
Explanation: We have 3 arithmetic slices in nums: [1, 2, 3], [2, 3, 4] and [1,2,3,4] itself.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [1]
Output: 0

/*
I used a dp array of size n + 1 to save subproblem solutions. 
dp[0] means an empty string will have one way to decode,
dp[1] means the way to decode a string of size 1.
I then check one digit and two digit combination and save the results along the way.
 In the end, dp[n] will be the end result.
