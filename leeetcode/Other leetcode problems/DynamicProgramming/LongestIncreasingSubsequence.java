/*
Given an integer array nums, return the length of the longest strictly increasing subsequence.

A subsequence is a sequence that can be derived from an array by deleting some or no elements without changing the order of the remaining elements. For example, [3,6,2,7] is a subsequence of the array [0,3,1,6,2,2,7].

 

Example 1:

Input: nums = [10,9,2,5,3,7,101,18]
Output: 4
Explanation: The longest increasing subsequence is [2,3,7,101], therefore the length is 4.
Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,1,0,3,2,3]
Output: 4
Example 3:

Input: nums = [7,7,7,7,7,7,7]
Output: 1
 

Constraints:

1 <= nums.length <= 2500
-104 <= nums[i] <= 104
 

Follow up:

Could you come up with the O(n2) solution?
Could you improve it to O(n log(n)) time complexity?

/**
this approach consists on making a list of increasing elements
if the next value is less than the current last element we need to 
add it to this list. to do so we use bin search to know were it would fit

finally we return the length of the list as the result.
